**Authors:** Reference Mohamed, A. M., Colomb, R. M., Ahmed, A. H., & Ahmed, R. E.

## Abstract
* The perdurant ontology and the conceptual dependency theory are briefly introduced in the abstract, but the study's methodology and findings are not fully described. 
* It also fails to explain why the examples given are unclear.

## Introduction 
* The relevance of the Internet, information systems, and how ontologies might improve the discovery process are all well-explained in the introduction. It does not, however, state a specific research question or the study's methodology. The mention of the number of internet users has no direct bearing on the paper's subject. Ontology is defined, however it may use more background information and context. Overall, even while the introduction gives some background information, it doesn't go into great length regarding the research being done.

## Endurant and Perdurant entities
* The introduction gives background information on the value of ontologies for enhancing the discovery process, but it makes no mention of the study's methodology or a specific research objective. The section on the amount of internet users seems unnecessary, and further context for the notion of ontology could be helpful.

## Perdurant Representation
* The key points are restated.
* This section gives a broad overview of endurant and perdurant entities, however the examples and justifications provided are insufficient. The section might need more in-depth examples and characteristics that distinguish between endurant and perdurant entities.

## Related Work
* In this section, the distinction between events and statives is covered, along with a comparison of perdurant ontologies from different frameworks. It emphasizes the need for a new representation and highlights the lack of standardized approaches to persistent ontologies representation.The purpose of the study is to provide a new representation of perdurant ontology to better understand the semantics of interactions between various participants.



## Conceptual Dependency (CD) Theory
* The two fundamental axioms of the Conceptual Dependency theory are explained in this section, along with how it gives actions or occurrences a meaning representation. On the other hand, it makes no clear mention of how the theory is used to ontologies.

## Perurant Ontology using CD Theory
* When it comes to the concept of "good results," the authors don't give one in the abstract of the work; instead, they outline the issue they are attempting to addressâ€”improving the caliber of search results for particular hotels in a city.
* Why the authors did not use a query based on CD Theory to resolve the issue is not made explicit.

## Discussions
* The final statement in the paragraph appears to be an artifact from the one before it and has nothing to do with the topic at hand. 

## Conslusion 
* The theory was only able to represent primitive actions and not more complex actions.
* It would have been advantageous to have more definitive results.
