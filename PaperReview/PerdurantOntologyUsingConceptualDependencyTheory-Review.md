# Perdurant Ontology Using Conceptual Dependency Theory

**Authors:** Reference Mohamed, A. M., Colomb, R. M., Ahmed, A. H., & Ahmed, R. E.

## Abstract
* It quickly discusses the two types of ontology entities, endurant and perdurant, and states the paper's main focus, which is the use of ontologies to improve discovery in the semantic web. The abstract introduces the methodology used in the research, which is based on the Conceptual Dependency theory, as well as the lack of common tools for describing and constructing perdurant.
* It gives no details regarding the precise process followed to create the Perdurant ontology or the duration of the study.
* The abstract does not explicitly express the research's conclusions or findings, despite mentioning the advantages of applying the Conceptual Dependency theory.

## Introduction 
* The relevance of the Internet, information systems, and how ontologies might improve the discovery process are all well-explained in the introduction. It does not, however, state a specific research question or the study's methodology. The mention of the number of internet users has no direct bearing on the paper's subject. Ontology is defined, however it may use more background information and context. Overall, even while the introduction gives some background information, it doesn't go into great length regarding the research being done.

## Endurant and Perdurant entities
* The section gives a general overview of the ideas of endurant and perdurant entities. The examples offered are unclear, and the explanations given are inadequate. The example's emphasis on "tiny" is ambiguous and offers little to further the point. Furthermore, the phrase "while perdurants extended in time" is unfinished and doesn't have a strong conclusion. More information on the distinguishing features of both endurant and perdurant entities, as well as more thorough examples to help with understanding, would have been beneficial. It also appears needless to mention repeatedly how BWW refers to endurant entities as "objects/things".

## Perdurant Representation
* The key points are restated.
* The distinction between events and statives is made, and the notion of perdurants as things that occur over time, specifically as events, is restated and compared across the BWW and DOLCE ontologies. While endurant ontologies can be represented using standardized languages like UML and OWL, the author emphasizes the significance of perdurant ontologies in depicting the relationship between endurants and events and points out that at the time of writing, there are no standardized tools for representing perdurant ontologies.
* The purpose of the author's study is to provide a new representation of the perdurant ontology in order to more fully comprehend the semantics of interactions between various participants. 

## Related Work
* According to the available data, it appears that M.Nazir and A.Ibrahim both employed UML profiles to describe perdurant instances but did not offer a solution for directly expressing perdurant instances. As OWL-S is more concerned with expressing web services than ontologies, A.Ibrahim also pointed out the drawbacks of using it to describe persistent ontologies. It would be beneficial to have further discussion on the reasons behind the selection of UML as the preferred method for describing perdurant instances, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using UML as opposed to other methods like OWL. 

## Conceptual Dependency (CD) Theory
* The two basic axioms of the theory help to extract the essence of similarities and differences between actions and to express them accordingly.
* They explain how the Conceptual Dependency theory provides a meaning representation for actions or events and how it is concerned with the intentional and contextual connections between events, particularly as they occur in human purposeful action sequences, but does not state how the theory is used explicitly ontologies.

## Perurant Ontology using CD Theory
* When it comes to the concept of "good results," the authors don't give one in the abstract of the work; instead, they outline the issue they are attempting to addressâ€”improving the caliber of search results for particular hotels in a city.
* Why the authors did not use a query based on CD Theory to resolve the issue is not made explicit.

## Discussions
* The final statement in the paragraph appears to be an artifact from the one before it and has nothing to do with the topic at hand. 

## Conslusion 
* The theory was only able to represent primitive actions and not more complex actions.
