#  Improving Knowledge Graph Understanding With Contexual Views


Introduction:
Knowledge graphs are a type of structured data that represent information in terms of entities and their relationships. Navigating large, complex knowledge graphs can be challenging, and traditional tools for exploration and analysis may not be sufficient. The InK Browser is a web-based tool designed to support interactive exploration of knowledge graphs, while flexible views enable users to customize the display of the graph to meet their needs. In this proposal, we will explore the InK Browser and its flexible view feature, with the goal of evaluating their effectiveness for knowledge graph exploration.

Research Questions:

What is the InK Browser, and how does it work?
How can we use the InK Browser for knowledge graph exploration?
What are the benefits of using the InK Browser with flexible views?
How can we implement flexible views in the InK Browser?
Methodology:
To address these research questions, we will conduct a literature review of relevant work on knowledge graph exploration, the InK Browser, and flexible views. We will also perform a case study using the InK Browser with flexible views, using a publicly available knowledge graph dataset. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the InK Browser and flexible views using metrics such as time to complete tasks, accuracy of results, and user satisfaction.

Expected Results:
We expect to find that the InK Browser is a useful tool for exploring knowledge graphs, and that the flexible view feature enhances its usability by allowing users to customize the display of the graph to meet their needs. We anticipate that the case study will demonstrate the effectiveness of the InK Browser with flexible views, and that users will find it to be a valuable tool for knowledge graph exploration.

Conclusion:
Knowledge graph exploration is an important area of research, with many potential applications in fields such as biomedical research, social network analysis, and business intelligence. The InK Browser and flexible views represent a promising approach to addressing the challenges of exploring large, complex knowledge graphs. By evaluating the effectiveness of these tools, we can gain a better understanding of how they can be used to support knowledge graph exploration and analysis, and identify areas for future research and development.
