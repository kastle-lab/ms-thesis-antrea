# Improving Knowledge Graph Understanding With Contexual Views
## _MS Thesis Proposal - Antrea Christou - KASTLE Lab - Wright State University - Spring 2023_


Questions to be answered :

- What is an INK Browser ?
- How do we use it ?
- Why do we use it ?
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the INK Browser when it is equipped with flexible view.
- How do we implement the flexible view ?
- What will it show ?

Our main goal would eventually help users to explore Linked Open Data (LOD) in a user-friendly manner. It provides a visual interface that displays data from multiple sources, making it easier to navigate and understand complex datasets.

The proposed thesis will investigate how the INK Browser can be improved with the implementation of flexible view. This view will allow users to customize the way in which they view and interact with the data.

The thesis will involve a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the INK Browser with flexible view. The study will aim to answer the questions of how we use the INK Browser and why we use it. Additionally, it will explore how to implement the flexible view and what it will show with users trying it in real time.
